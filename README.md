# Matapopulation_growth_model
This is my little MATLAB project which implements a mix of the _*Nakazawa*_ and the _*Vandermeer-Carvajal*_ model for metapopulation growth in a given territory.

The explanation can be found in italian in the file "MY EXPLANATION.pdf". One day, maybe not too far away from now, I will win against my laziness and provide an english explanation for the model in this file. Till that moment, these are the links for the two papers, and the wikipedia page which explains the concept of meta-population:
